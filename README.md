# EnronHamSpam
Python program to classify emails as ham (legitimate) or spam.

**Steps to run code:**
1. Use any IDE which supports Python (I used PyCharm)
2. Create a "repository" folder on your machine from PyCharm.
3. Download the 7z file and .py file to your newly created folder.
5. Open the .py file.
6. Change line 18 of the .py file (the base path line).
7. Edit the code as appropriate.

NOTE: For the python interpreter, D.I.Y!

Precision, recall & accuracy metrics generally sit at around 60%; was the best result I could get.

I ran my code on my laptop, which isn't the fastest, so I was unable to optimize the pre-processing tasks to get better results.
